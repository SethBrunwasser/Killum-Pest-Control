      First time home pest control services  includes Cockroach bait under all sinks and Pesticide dusting,  plus all interior baseboards sprayed with a non odor pesticide.  We also spray behind the refrigerator, laundry machines, dish washer and stove.  The outside of the home includes the garage and the entire linear foundation, and  the entire Perimeter of the property to ensure a Pest free environment.  In the rocky areas of the landscape we use a Granule pesticide to control pests all the way down the soil. I also dust or Spray the block wall cracks and  inside water the meter and irrigation covers.  This treatment  is one of the most complete in the Valley.

Monthly Services do not include the interior of the property unless Pest problems are still occurring.  If a retreatment of the inside is necessary it would be included in the monthly fee.

Rodent Control Service requires us to stop by your home a few times  to eradicate the Pests.  My system is complete and works fantastic!  KPCS cannot be responsible for where the poisoned Rodent dies, an additional service fee will apply whether we are successful or not in finding the dead rodent.

Beehive removal can be very difficult and expensive.  I am very carful to minimize the structure damage that may occur during the removal of the Beehive.  My fee's do not include the repairs necessary to repair your home or business.  All repairs are the responsibility of the Business or Home owner since we are not  Licensed Contractors.

All services are guaranteed for thirty days from the date of treatment.
